I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the College of Optical Science and Engineering at Zhejiang University. Under the mentorship of Dr. Chen Yueting, I also receive valuable guidance from Professors Xu Zhihai, Feng Huajun, and Li Qi. Additionally, I am a trainee researcher at the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, working closely with Xue Tianfan, Gu Jinwei, Guo Shi, Zhao Bin, and Li Xuelong. My research interests are primarily in optical imaging and low-level vision.
