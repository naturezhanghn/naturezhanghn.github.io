## About Me

I am a Senior Vision Algorithm Engineer at **[Honor](https://www.honor.com/cn/)**, specializing in the development and deployment of cutting-edge imaging technologies driven by artificial intelligence. I earned my Ph.D. from the **[College of Optical Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University](http://opt.zju.edu.cn/)** in June 2025, where I conducted my doctoral research under the mentorship of **[Dr. Yueting Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YuetingChenProfile)** and co-supervision from **[Prof. Tianfan Xue](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0098047)** as part of the prestigious **[Pujiang National Laboratory Joint Training Ph.D. Program (2022-2025)](https://www.shlab.org.cn/news/5443403.html)**. My research expertise spans optical engineering and AI-enhanced imaging, with a particular emphasis on generative artificial intelligence and its applications in cloud-based image enhancement.

My professional work focuses on harnessing generative AI models to advance imaging algorithms, optimize sensor data interpretation, and pioneer novel cloud-based computational imaging methodologies. I have led and contributed to numerous projects that integrate AI with optics and computer vision, resulting in significant advancements in image synthesis, enhancement, and real-time processing.

I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Optoelectronic Information Science and Engineering from **[Central South University](https://www.csu.edu.cn/)**, where I graduated at the top of my class and was honored with the **National Scholarship** and recognition as an **Outstanding Graduate of Hunan Province**. I pursued an integrated Master’s and Ph.D. program at Zhejiang University, with my Master’s research focused on computational imaging under the guidance of **[Prof. Huajun Feng](http://opt.zju.edu.cn/people/fenghuajun)**.

Throughout my doctoral studies, I had the privilege to collaborate with leading experts including **[Shi Guo](https://guoshi28.github.io/)**, **[Zhihai Xu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0089108)**, **[Jinwei Gu](https://www.gujinwei.org/)**, **[Xuelong Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ahUibskAAAAJ&hl=zh-TW)**, **[Qi Li](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0098047)**, and **[Bin Zhao](https://iopen.nwpu.edu.cn/info/1251/1852.htm)**, collectively pushing the boundaries of AI-driven imaging science.
