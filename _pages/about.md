## About Me

I am a Senior Imaging Algorithm Engineer at **[Honor](https://www.honor.com/cn/)**, with a strong academic foundation and extensive experience in the fields of artificial intelligence and optical imaging. I hold a Ph.D. from the **[College of Optical Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University](http://opt.zju.edu.cn/)**, completed in June 2025, where I conducted cutting-edge research jointly with **[Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/)**.

Throughout my career, I have focused on bridging the gap between AI and imaging technologies to develop innovative solutions that enhance image quality, sensor performance, and computational photography. My work integrates expertise in optics, computer vision, graphics, and sensor technologies to push the boundaries of imaging science.

I began my academic journey with a Bachelor of Science in Optoelectronic Information Science and Engineering from **[Central South University](https://www.csu.edu.cn/)**, graduating among the top of my class and earning the **National Scholarship** as well as recognition as an **Outstanding Graduate of Hunan Province**. I then pursued a Master of Science degree at Zhejiang University under the mentorship of **Prof. Huajun Feng**, focusing on modern optical instrumentation.

During my Ph.D., I was honored to be part of the inaugural cohort of the **[Pujiang National Laboratory Joint Training Ph.D. Program (2022-2025)](https://www.shlab.org.cn/news/5443403.html)**, where I conducted research under the supervision of **Dr. Yueting Chen** and co-supervision from **Prof. Tianfan Xue**. This experience allowed me to collaborate with leading researchers such as **Shi Guo**, **Zhihai Xu**, **Jinwei Gu**, **Xuelong Li**, **Qi Li**, and **Bin Zhao**, contributing to impactful projects at the forefront of AI for imaging.

### Research Interests

My research and professional interests include:

- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Imaging  
- Optical Engineering and Photonics  
- Computer Vision and Graphics  
- Sensor Design and Signal Processing  
- Computational Photography and Image Enhancement  

I am passionate about leveraging interdisciplinary approaches to create advanced imaging systems and algorithms that have real-world impact.
