## About Me

I am a Senior Imaging Algorithm Engineer at **[Honor](https://www.honor.com/cn/)**, specializing in the development and application of advanced imaging technologies powered by artificial intelligence. With a Ph.D. from the **[College of Optical Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University](http://opt.zju.edu.cn/)** completed in June 2025, I have cultivated deep expertise in both optical engineering and AI-driven imaging solutions, including extensive hands-on experience in generative artificial intelligence.

My professional focus lies in leveraging generative AI models to enhance imaging algorithms, improve sensor data interpretation, and create innovative computational photography techniques. I have led and contributed to multiple projects that integrate generative AI with optics and computer vision, driving breakthroughs in image synthesis, enhancement, and real-time processing.

My academic background includes a Bachelor of Science in Optoelectronic Information Science and Engineering from **[Central South University](https://www.csu.edu.cn/)**, where I graduated top of my class and received the **National Scholarship** and recognition as an **Outstanding Graduate of Hunan Province**. I earned my Master of Science degree at Zhejiang University under the guidance of **Prof. Huajun Feng**, focusing on modern optical instrumentation.

During my Ph.D., I was honored to join the inaugural cohort of the **[Pujiang National Laboratory Joint Training Ph.D. Program (2022-2025)](https://www.shlab.org.cn/news/5443403.html)**, conducting research under **Dr. Yueting Chen** and co-supervision from **Prof. Tianfan Xue**. This experience enabled me to collaborate with leading experts such as **[Shi Guo](https://guoshi28.github.io/)**, **[Zhihai Xu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0089108)**, **[Jinwei Gu](https://www.gujinwei.org/)**, **[Xuelong Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ahUibskAAAAJ&hl=zh-TW)**, **[Qi Li](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0098047)**, and **[Bin Zhao](https://iopen.nwpu.edu.cn/info/1251/1852.htm)**, advancing the frontiers of AI for imaging.

### Research Interests

My research and engineering expertise encompass:

- Generative Artificial Intelligence for Imaging  
- Optical Engineering and Photonics  
- Computer Vision and Graphics  
- Sensor Technologies and Signal Processing  
- Computational Photography and Image Enhancement  

I am passionate about harnessing interdisciplinary approaches to develop state-of-the-art imaging systems and AI algorithms with practical impact.
